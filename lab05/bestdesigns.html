    <h2> Best Design Practices and why!</h2>
    <p>1.Keep Stylesheets Organized: A well-organized stylesheet is easier to maintain and scale. This includes separating different parts of your CSS into different files or sections.</p>
    <p>2.Responsive Design Principles: With the increasing number of devices and screen sizes, it's very important to have your design responsive all screens no matter the screen size. Using media queries and flexible layouts helps make sure your website works properly on all devices.</p>
    <p>3. Flexbox or CSS Grid for Layouts: Flexbox and Grid provide powerful and modern methods to create complex layouts without the need for floats or manual positioning.They offer more flexibility and responsiveness.</p>
