            <h2>Why i always prefer the Lexus brand vehicles for affordability??</h2>
            <p> Lexus is a Toyota Brand just a luxury version so when i need repairs i can purchase Toyota parts which are less expensive then actual Lexus brand parts.</p>
            <p> Lexus vehicles have been known to easily gain up to 400k miles and still maintain good drive train function on teh road.</p>

        <h3> With Lexus brand you don't have to break the bank!</h3>
        <p> Compared to other high-end car brands like BMW, Mercedez, and, Jaquar Lexus really does stand out. A oil change for the brands listed  besides Lexus are priced at about $120 or more while a standard oil change for a Lexus is about $50. </p>
